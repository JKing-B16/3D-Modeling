# Summary

This has been designed to house a Raspberry Pi Zero and Pi camera all in one package. No supports are required if you orientate everything correctly.

1. The camhinge is a push fit into the campicase and my tolerances were such that I didn't need to glue it.
2. The Pi camera is installed in the camcase and the camcaselid clips on the back securing it.
3. The Pi camera cable (for the Zero) passes though the camhinge into the campicase and is inserted into the Pi Zero slot.
4. The camcase is secured to the camhinge using a M3 25mm bolt and nut.
5. The Pi Zero is secured into the case with M2.5 5mm screws.
6. The campicaselid clips on to the campicase.

I set up my Pi with Raspbian and Motion Eye to provide streaming. These are the steps I took to get Motion Eye running on the zero:

This results in a fully configurable security camera with motion detection, local/remote storage of images captured, email notifications of movement etc.
