This model is inpired by the eybrows of artist Frida Kahlo.

The uni-brow prints with a 4mm hole that serves as the mounting point for the handle.  Attatch the handle with some E6000 or similar adhesive.  A kitchen skewer (bamboo type) works great as a eyebrow handle.

I used the workflow seen in this video to make the 3D model: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQLZ3bVWxg
